Pros and cons of TDD:
Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a software development approach has both advantages and drawbacks. On the positive side, TDD results in better code quality by requiring that tests  be written before implementing code, ensuring that developers meet specified requirements and functions correctly. This approach results in a cleaner, more reliable codebase with fewer bugs. Another positive of TDD is that allows for issues to be detected early and this prevents issues from accumulating and becoming a problem later in the development process. TDD also promotes better software design by encouraging developers to think about modular and maintainable code. Finally failing tests help in pinpointing issues, making debugging a more efficient process.
Â 
In terms of drawbacks TDD demands more time and effort as tests must be written before code. There is also a considerable maintenance overhead associated with TDD, as the test suite needs constant updates to stay in sync with code changes. Overengineering is also a risk, as developers may overcomplicate code to make it more testable, resulting in unnecessary complexity. Lastly, since passing tests do not guarantee a bug-free application, both through possible gaps in testing and through possible errors within the tests themselves, having tests pass could create a false sense of security and lead to problems later on.
